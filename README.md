This was my first full Python Project. Mini and Basic Project Build in python using some basic libraries like cv2,pyzbar.
The project manages and validates the books in the library. It was created as the coursework for my Introduction to programming module.
The library Management System was created to be as easy to use as possible by the end-user.
